# Noodle Project

The Noodle Project is a pet snake environment controller. The project does things like act as a thermostat for heating elements and record environment humidity and temperature.

*Just a note:* CMake is a real drain on my life.

## TODO

- Shut off heat sources if the temperature reading fails.
